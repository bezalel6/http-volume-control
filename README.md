## Required Binaries

This project requires Windows command-line utilities to control audio. You have two options:

### Option 1: Download Pre-packaged Binaries
Download `http-volume-control-binaries.zip` from the [releases page](../../releases) and extract all files to the `binaries/` folder.

### Option 2: Download Individually
See [binaries/README.md](binaries/README.md) for manual download instructions.

The following utilities are required:
- [SoundVolumeCommandLine](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/sound_volume_command_line.html) - Audio control
- [GetNir](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/get_nir_command_line_tool.html) - CSV filtering (required for svcl.exe output parsing)
